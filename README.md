# Computational-Statistics

My name is Neo Nguyen, and my Shiny app examines factors affecting life expectancy, using a data set containing numerous countries. The app computes the linear regression models of 10 predictors in conjunction with the life expectancy values in order to derive an understanding of factors affecting life expectancy. The app can be accessed through the link below: https://neonguyen.shinyapps.io/testshiny/. You can also use the command in R: runGitHub("Computational-Statistics", "neonguyen2016")
